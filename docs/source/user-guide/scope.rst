Bermuda's Scope
===================

Bermuda is a package for the representation
and manipulation of loss triangles that is
extremely flexible.
It's purpose is to make the handling
of realistically-complex
insurance loss triangles quick
and easy. Bermuda can read and write
triangles from/to a number of different
data formats, allowing for integration
with other software straight-forward.
Bermuda also is the primary triangle input data
structure to the rest of `Korra's <korra.com>`_
modeling ecosystem.
